# HR-Analytics-Visualizing-Employee-Attrition-Trends-Power-BI

## Description:

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition within an organization using an interactive dashboard built in Power BI. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of attrition trends and patterns to aid HR teams in understanding key factors influencing employee turnover.

Key features of the dashboard include:

Summary Metrics: Displayed key statistics such as total employees (1,470), total attrition (237), and overall attrition rate (16.09%).
Demographic Analysis: Explored attrition by age, gender, and educational background, identifying high attrition rates among specific groups (e.g., age group 26-35 and employees with life sciences and medical degrees).
Salary-Based Analysis: Highlighted a strong correlation between attrition and lower salary brackets, with 69% of attrition occurring in the "up to 5k" category.
Tenure Insights: Analyzed attrition by years of service, revealing peak turnover in employees with 0-5 years of tenure.
Job Role Trends: Visualized attrition distribution across roles, with laboratory technicians and sales executives showing the highest turnover.
Department Segmentation: Included filters for departments like Human Resources, Sales, and Research & Development to enable focused analysis.
Tools and Techniques Used:

Power BI: Created dynamic visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and trend lines for actionable insights.
Data Analysis: Applied data cleaning, transformation, and modeling techniques to prepare the dataset for visualization.
Insight Delivery: Identified key drivers of attrition, aiding decision-makers in devising retention strategies.
The dashboard serves as a valuable tool for HR professionals to reduce employee turnover and optimize workforce management strategies.
